Assignment 1 of ID

The purpose of this website is to show recruiters who are browsing
the website, my skills, education, awards and projects. This is so
as to show that i am a capable person so that i have a higher chance
of getting hired.

This website provides information such as my education history,
skillsets, projects i have done in the past as well as my work
experience and interests. This is so as to provide the more important information to recruiters trying to hire me.

This Website showcases my profile and consists of the skills
and experiences i have attained during this small time.
The website has 4 HTML Files and 1 CSS file. The 4 HTML files
are for each page of the website Home, About, Projects and Contact.
This makes it easier for users to navigate through the website
to get to the part that would like to see.
My CSS file has many classes named after their purposes
to make it easier to differentiate between classes.

Some of the features this website includes is a "back to the top"
button which by clicking, it brings the user back
to the top of the page. Another feature is the "Email Me"
where a user can send an email to me through the website
and once the email has been sent, the user will get a popup
that thanks them for reaching out to me.
